The dataset contains information about age, sex, BMI, number of children, if they smoke, and region of residence for individuals. The overall goal is to develop a model that can predict the insurance charges for new individuals based on all of these features\n",

        "\n",
        "The main challenge is the complexity of the relationships between the features and the target variable that is trying to be acheived. Therfore, it is important to use appropriate feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features and make the model as simple as possible. With this in mind, we also want to prevent overfitting, but this can be avoided and reduced by regularization and cross validation.\n",

        "\n",

        "**Parameter Tuning: **\n",
        "\n",
        "This is an important step in building this model because it allows us to select the best hyperparameters so that the model is able to perform the best. In our baseline model, we get an accuracy of 78 percent, and a total insurance cost of 5829.38, but this will change with the final model being fine tuned\n",

        "**Model Comparison:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the random forrest regressor performs much better than the linear regression model in both RMSE and R^2. The random forrest regressor has a RMSE and R^2 of 4571.34 and 86 percent, wheras the linear regression model has a RMSE and R^2 of 5829.38 and 78 percent. The random forrest regressor is able to perform better because it can capture nonlinear relationships between the feature and the target variable, wheras the linear regressor assumes that there is a linear relationship. The random forrest generator is also able to handle categorical variables much better, therfore, the random forrest regressor is a better choice and a better model for predicting insurance charges for this problem."
